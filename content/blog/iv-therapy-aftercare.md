A thoughtful aftercare routine maximizes the benefits of any wellness treatment. Here are a few simple steps from the VitaVera nurses to keep you glowing long after your infusion ends.

1. **Hydrate well.** Aim for at least half your body weight in ounces of water within 24 hours.
2. **Refuel smart.** Choose lean protein, colorful vegetables, and whole grains to stabilize energy levels.
3. **Rest intentionally.** Quality sleep allows your body to put those nutrients to work.
4. **Plan your next visit.** Consistency keeps your immune system supported and recovery on track.
